**Fundamentals**

**What is Cloud?**

The "cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. By using cloud computing, individuals and companies don't need to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. It enables faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.

**Types of Cloud**

There are mainly three types of cloud environments, distinguished by the ownership, size, and access model. These are:

**Public Cloud:** In a public cloud, the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, which delivers them over the Internet. Customers share these resources. Examples include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Public clouds are most beneficial for their scalability, reliability, and flexibility.

**Private Cloud:** A private cloud is dedicated to the needs and goals of a single organization. It can be hosted in a company's own data center or by a third-party service provider. But in either case, the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network. Private clouds offer more control and security, making them ideal for businesses with strict data regulations, sensitive applications, or high demands for customization.

**Hybrid Cloud:** This cloud environment combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. A hybrid cloud gives businesses greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize existing infrastructure, security, and compliance. It is particularly useful for balancing between the need for scalability on one hand and the need for security and control on the other.

****Vocabulary****

**API (Application Programming Interface):**
An API is a set of rules and definitions that allows software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary, enabling developers to use complex functionalities without needing to understand their internal workings.

**Virtualization:** 
The process of creating a virtual (rather than physical) version of something, such as virtual servers, storage, or networks. It allows for better resource utilization and flexibility.

**Virtual Machine (VM):**
A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer. It behaves like a physical computer and can run an operating system and applications. However, unlike a physical computer, a VM runs on virtualized hardware provided by a hypervisor. This allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine, known as the host.

_Hypervisor:_ A hypervisor is a software layer that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical hardware platform. It manages the resources of the host machine and allocates them to each virtual machine.

_Host Machine:_ The physical hardware on which virtual machines are created and run. It provides computing resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking.

**Server:** 
A computer program or device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, known as clients. In cloud computing, servers typically refer to the physical or virtual machines that run applications or services.

**Scaling:** 
The process of increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to an application or service based on demand. Scaling can be vertical (adding more power to existing resources) or horizontal (adding more resources).

**Elasticity:** 
The ability of a system to dynamically adjust the amount of resources allocated based on demand. It ensures that the system can handle varying workloads without sacrificing performance or incurring unnecessary costs.

**Load Balancing:** 
The process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and increase availability. It prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed by requests.

**High Availability:**
A characteristic of a system or component that ensures it remains operational for a specified period, usually referring to minimizing downtime and maximizing uptime.

**Disaster Recovery:** 
A set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster.
