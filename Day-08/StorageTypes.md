### **1. Blob Storage**

- **What it is**: Azure Blob Storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS.

- **When to use**: It's ideal for serving images or documents directly to a browser, storing files for distributed access, streaming video and audio, writing to log files, and storing data for backup, disaster recovery, and archiving.

- **Which files can be stored**: Practically any type of text or binary data, such as application installers, data dumps, logs, real-time analytics data, images, videos, and more.

- **Equivalent service in other platforms**:
  - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Google Cloud Storage

### **2. File Storage**

- **What it is**: Azure File Storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the SMB protocol.

- **When to use**: It's suitable for migrating existing on-premises file shares to the cloud, storing shared files that can be accessed simultaneously by multiple machines or applications, and lifting and shifting legacy applications that rely on file share storage to the cloud.

- **Which files can be stored**: Any file type suitable for SMB protocol access, including documents, spreadsheets, images, and application data files.

- **Equivalent service in other platforms**:
  - **AWS**: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
  - **GCP**: Filestore

### **3. Table Storage**

- **What it is**: Azure Table Storage is a NoSQL data store for semi-structured data. It's highly scalable and serves as a great option for storing large volumes of data without the need for a complex relational database.

- **When to use**: Ideal for applications that require storing large amounts of non-relational data, rapid development without the complexity of relational schema, and services that require a flexible data schema or store datasets that evolve over time.

- **Which files can be stored**: Semi-structured data like JSON or XML documents, flexible schemas containing mixed data types, and large volumes of data without complex relationships.

- **Equivalent service in other platforms**:
  - **AWS**: DynamoDB
  - **GCP**: Cloud Datastore

### **4. Queue Storage**

- **What it is**: Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS.

- **When to use**: It's used for building flexible applications and separating functions for better reliability, scaling applications to handle heavy load operations, and ensuring loose coupling between application components.

- **Which files can be stored**: Messages, up to 64 KB in size, which can contain information such as work to be processed, notifications, or any other form of data to be communicated between different parts of an application.

- **Equivalent service in other platforms**:
  - **AWS**: Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
  - **GCP**: Cloud Pub/Sub (for messaging and streaming analytics) and Cloud Tasks (for task queues).
