### 1. **Azure VNet (Virtual Network)**:
   - Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a logically isolated network in Azure. It enables you to securely connect Azure resources together, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), and to on-premises networks.
   - VNets can be segmented into multiple subnets, allowing you to organize and isolate resources based on their function or security requirements.
   - Example: Imagine you're building a web application that consists of a front-end and a back-end. You can create a VNet for each tier (front-end and back-end), with separate subnets for web servers, application servers, and databases.

### 2. **Azure Application Gateway**:
   - Azure Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer that enables you to manage web traffic to your web applications.
   - It provides features like SSL termination, URL-based routing, session affinity, and web application firewall (WAF) for enhanced security.
   - Application Gateway helps distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability and scalability for your web applications.
   - Example: Suppose you have multiple web servers hosting the front-end of your application. By using Azure Application Gateway, you can distribute incoming HTTP requests among these servers based on URL paths or other criteria.

### 3. **Azure Load Balancer**:
   - Azure Load Balancer is a Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers or VM instances.
   - It provides high availability by detecting unhealthy instances and rerouting traffic to healthy instances.
   - Load Balancer operates at the network level and can be used for both internal and external load balancing scenarios.
   - Example: If you have a pool of virtual machines serving as backend servers for a database application, Azure Load Balancer can evenly distribute incoming database queries across these VMs to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

### 4. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
   - DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.
   - Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.
   - It allows you to manage DNS records for your domain within Azure, providing high availability and low latency.
   - Example: When a user enters a domain name in their web browser, DNS resolves that domain name to the IP address of the server hosting the website. In Azure, you can use Azure DNS to manage the DNS records for your web applications, ensuring that users can access them by domain name.

### 5. **NSG (Network Security Group)**:
   - NSG is a fundamental security feature in Azure that acts as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (VMs, Azure Kubernetes Service, etc.) within a VNet or subnet.
   - NSGs allow you to define security rules based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols to control traffic flow.
   - They provide an additional layer of security by filtering network traffic at the network level.
   - Example: You can create NSG rules to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) only to your web servers, while restricting access to other ports. Similarly, you can set up outbound rules to restrict access from your VMs to specific destinations or services.
