### Step 1: VNet Creation and Subnet Configuration

1. **VNet Creation**: 
   - Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) named "ExampleVNet" in your Azure subscription.
   - Choose an appropriate address space (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) for the VNet.

2. **Subnet Configuration**:
   - Within "ExampleVNet", create the following subnets:
     - Frontend Subnet: For web servers and the Azure Application Gateway.
     - Backend Subnet: For application and database servers.

### Step 2: Deploying Azure Services

3. **Azure Application Gateway / Load Balancer Deployment**:
   - Deploy Azure Application Gateway or Azure Load Balancer in the Frontend Subnet of "ExampleVNet".
   - Configure Application Gateway for SSL termination and URL-based routing, if required.
   - If using Azure Load Balancer, set up rules for distributing traffic among backend servers.

4. **Web Server Deployment**:
   - Deploy web servers (e.g., Azure Virtual Machines) behind the Application Gateway or Load Balancer in the Frontend Subnet.
   - Install and configure web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS) on these VMs.

5. **Application and Database Server Deployment**:
   - Deploy application and database servers (e.g., Azure VMs, Azure SQL Database) in the Backend Subnet.
   - Install and configure application and database software (e.g., Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB) on these servers.

### Step 3: DNS Configuration

6. **DNS Record Setup**:
   - Configure DNS records using Azure DNS or a third-party DNS provider to map your domain name (e.g., www.example.com) to the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway or Load Balancer.
   - Set up appropriate DNS records for your backend servers if needed.

### Step 4: Network Security Configuration

7. **Network Security Group (NSG) Configuration**:
   - Create and configure NSGs to control traffic flow within "ExampleVNet":
     - Define rules to allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the Frontend Subnet for web servers.
     - Apply rules to restrict direct access to backend servers in the Backend Subnet, allowing only necessary communication from web servers.

### User Interaction Flow

When a user interacts with www.example.com:

1. **DNS Resolution**:
   - The user's browser sends a DNS resolution request to resolve www.example.com.
   - The DNS resolver returns the IP address associated with www.example.com, pointing to the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway or Load Balancer.

2. **Traffic Routing and Load Balancing**:
   - The user's browser sends an HTTP request to the IP address of the Azure Application Gateway or Load Balancer.
   - Application Gateway or Load Balancer receives the request and forwards it to one of the web servers behind it in the Frontend Subnet.

3. **Request Processing**:
   - The web server processes the request, generating a response.
   - If needed, the web server may interact with application or database servers located in the Backend Subnet over the Azure VNet.

4. **Network Security Enforcement**:
   - NSGs enforce security policies, ensuring that only allowed traffic flows within "ExampleVNet".
   - Communication between web servers and backend servers is secured and restricted as per NSG rules.

By following this structured approach, you can efficiently set up a scalable, secure, and well-organized network architecture for your web application within Azure.
