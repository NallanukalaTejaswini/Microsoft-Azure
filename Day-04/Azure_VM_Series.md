**Ideal for:** Memory-intensive applications like SAP HANA, large databases, and in-memory analytics.
**Features:** High memory-to-core ratios and support for premium storage.
**Price Point:** Starting from $58.40 per month.

### **F-Series: Compute Optimized VMs**
**Ideal for:** Compute-intensive applications such as batch processing, analytics, and gaming.

**Features:** High CPU-to-memory ratio and optional high-speed local SSDs.

**Price Point:** Starting from $35.77 per month.

### **G-Series: Memory and Storage Optimized VMs**

**Ideal for:** Large databases, ERP systems, and data warehousing solutions requiring significant memory and storage.

**Features:** High memory and SSD storage capacities.

**Price Point:** Starting from $320.47 per month.

### **H-Series: High-Performance Computing VMs**
**Ideal for:** High Performance Computing (HPC) applications like financial analysis, scientific modeling, and simulations.

**Features:** High CPU core counts, significant RAM, and specialized for compute-intensive tasks.

**Price Point:** Starting from $581.08 per month.

### **Ls-Series: Storage Optimized VMs**
**Ideal for:** Workloads requiring high throughput and low latency, such as big data, SQL, and NoSQL databases.

**Features:** Large local SSD storage and high I/O performance.

**Price Point:** Starting from $455.52 per month.

### **M-Series: Memory Optimized VMs**
**Ideal for:** Extremely memory-intensive applications like large in-memory databases (e.g., SAP HANA).

**Features:** Offers up to 4 TB of RAM for the most demanding memory workloads.

**Price Point:** Starting from $1,121.28 per month.

### **Mv2-Series: Largest Memory Optimized VMs**
**Ideal for:** The largest memory-intensive applications needing up to 12 TB of memory.

**Features:** Extremely high memory options and significant computational capabilities.

**Note:** Specific pricing details were not provided, indicating the need for custom quotes based on the deployment scale and configuration.

Each series is designed to cater to specific workload requirements, from general-purpose tasks to specialized high-performance computing. Pricing varies based on the VM's capacity, storage options, and the Azure region in which the VM is deployed. Azure also offers options to customize VMs further with additional storage, faster CPUs, and more memory, allowing users to tailor their virtual machines to their precise needs.
